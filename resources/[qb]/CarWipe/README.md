**Hello,**

I myself was always looking for a good working script for a carwipe every hour for example, but never really could find something good, and something that actually did it right. So I made my own version of a carwipe script.

# CarWipe-FiveM
A script that allows you to run a carwipe every so often (hours/minutes), this will remove all cars that no one is in to prevent lag. This script does not cause any performance loss.

### Features:

- Change time for carwipe with cron:runAt in the server.lua
- Notifications when a carwipe is upcoming and done in config
- Config the 10ms delay x vehicle to delete
- Multiple delete functions so the vehicle always goes away
- A command to manually start a carwipe if you like
- Delete & Normal destroyed vehicle's
- A option to use ESX or not
- Not deleting of someone is driveing the vehicle
- A option to only carwipe broken vehicles [PREVIEW v1.1.1](https://youtu.be/WGoHoXCuaVE)

  _This script has a version check, new versions will be released regularly, so you can see it right at the start of the server._
